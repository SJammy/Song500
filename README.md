# Song500
The project is a microsite called Song500 that explores the feasibility of using songs to learn a second language. 

The concept is based on the idea that music aids memory, and learning the top 500 words of a language is a good starting point to build vocabulary and gain confidence. 

The website details a  prospective step-by-step process for using Song500, including selecting an artist and song, using a word translator, and marking off words in a top 500 list. Additionally, a daily email with two words from the user's still-to-learn list.

The micorsite includes a lyrics word checker, where users can enter their own song lyrics to practice vocabulary.
