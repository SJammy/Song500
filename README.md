Learn a Language by Learning Songs

Song500 is a vanilla JavaScript web application that helps users learn a new language by teaching them the lyrics to popular songs in that language. The concept is based on the idea that music aids memory, and learning the top 500 words of a language is a good starting point to build vocabulary and gain confidence.
